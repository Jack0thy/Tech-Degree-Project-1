        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I've spent the past 7 or so years working towards obtaining a Master's degree in Political Economy.  My research has to do with cooperative governance of digital networks and I'm looking to further my career by adding a more practical element by becoming a proficient coder. </p>
        <p>My original thought was to jump into a computer science program, but after doing some research it seemed like treehouse was the way to go for me.</p>
        <p>Once I've finished the Front-End Development Course, I'm hoping to also complete the Full-Stack JavaScript course.  With these two courses under my belt, I feel like I will be well on my way to being where I want to be for computer science.</p>
        <p>Beyond all of this, I'm also looking to develop myself as a writer. </p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>My primary goal is to become very proficient in JavaScript, but I would also like to be able to consider myself as a well rounded coder.  Further, I would also like to one day develop websites for artistic passion.  Thus, at this point I would like to become efficient in: </p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Ruby</li>
          <li>Rails</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Ultimately, I would like to be a part of developing decentralized autonomous organizations that have a cooperative governance model and opperate under the political philosophy of collective governance of the commons.  </p>
